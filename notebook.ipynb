      "content=\"Victory Mansions is a building characterized by its glass doors, which Winston Smith quickly enters. Inside, the hallway has a smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. A large colored poster on the wall features an enormous face of a man with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. The building has a lift that is rarely operational, and currently, the electric current is cut off during daylight hours as part of an economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. Winston's flat is located seven flights up, and he struggles to climb the stairs due to a varicose ulcer above his right ankle. The overall atmosphere of Victory Mansions is dreary and uninviting.\"\n"
